# XState + Playwright Model-Based Testing POC

This is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) project demonstrating model-based testing using Playwright and XState.

## Purpose

The aim of this POC is to explore the feasibility and benefits of using XState to model application behavior and drive Playwright end-to-end tests.

## Technologies

- **Playwright:** For browser automation and end-to-end testing
- **XState:** For creating and managing finite state machines
- **React/TypeScript:** For project development

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js (>= 18):** Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
- **Npm:** Install Npm globally: `npm install -g npm`
- **Yarn:** Install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the tests:**
    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

## Key Concepts

- **State Machines:** XState machines define the application's states and transitions.
- **Playwright Integration:** Playwright actions are triggered based on state transitions.
- **Test Generation:** Tests are generated based on the state machine's paths.

## Future Enhancements (POC Limitations)

- Expand the state machine to cover more complex application scenarios
- Implement more robust test data management
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Improve reporting
